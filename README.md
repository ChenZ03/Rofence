# TowerDefence
Just run the main.py in TowerDefence/main.py

Rules : 
Build towers to defend and prevent the "Orge" to reach the endpoint
You were given 10 Hp, 100 Coin and a "Short Tower" during the game start

Controls:
Drag the Tower from the shop menu (located below the game)
The Tower will cost 100 or 300 depending on which tower you choose....Short Tower cost 100 coins while Long Tower cost 300 coins
Short Tower : Higher Damage but shorter range
Long Tower : Long Range with decent Dmg

PS : The assets weren't complete yet. Therefore the "Robot" is replaced with the Orge and the "Tesla" is replaced with the Long and Short Tower

There are also temporary Maps and Shops
